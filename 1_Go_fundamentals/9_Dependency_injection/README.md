# Dependency Injection

## What is dependency injection?

Dependency injection relies on interface, we set different interface implementation for different purpose.

> But it changes the function behaviors and introduce new variable, in real testing we should avoid this. I think separate "domain" code from "side effect" is the right way to test for the functions' result we can't capture.
